[A mini-RTS about fortifying and defending a mining colony.]

Assume command of the empire's latest mining expedition via our experimental allegiance-reaffirming neural interface! Establish a foothold on this sickening planet and extract all the ore you can manage, while repelling the efforts of that which crawls up freshly-minted boreholes.

You needn't concern yourself with the nature of the things living down there. Unless it's to deploy a biological disruptor warhead and scour clean this horrible place, leaving only rich veins and writhing mantle.

Fortify your position and wait for the caravans. And don't ask any questions.
